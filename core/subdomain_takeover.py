def run(domain):
    print(f"[Subdomain Takeover] Checking {domain}...")
    # Placeholder logic - replace this with actual takeover detection
    # Example:
    # - Check for dangling CNAMEs
    # - Identify unclaimed cloud services
    # - Print or store findings

    # For now, just simulate:
    print(f"[Subdomain Takeover] Scan complete for {domain}")
